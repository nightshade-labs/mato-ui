**Tired of Losing on Current DEXs? We Get It.**

Whether you're trading tokens or managing assets, today's decentralized exchanges come with frustrating pain points:

*   **High Price Impact & Slippage:** Large trades often execute far worse than expected due to low liquidity.
*   **Front-Running Bots:** Predatory bots exploit your orders, especially during volatile times.
*   **Confusing Interfaces:** Many platforms are overwhelming with complex charts and settings.
*   **Transaction Failures:** Trades can fail unexpectedly, wasting time and potential fees.

You deserve a trading experience that's simple, fair, and reliable.

**Introducing Mato: Trade Smarter, Not Harder.**

Mato rethinks decentralized trading on Solana with a unique approach focused on *fair* execution and user simplicity.

Instead of forcing an instant swap that can be manipulated or suffer slippage, Mato executes your trade *gradually* over a duration you choose.

**(Section highlighting Core Benefits with simple icons)**

**‚úÖ Get Better Prices**
By executing your trade over time, Mato minimizes the price impact your order has on the market, helping you achieve a fairer average price compared to an immediate, large swap.

**üõ°Ô∏è Always-On Bot Protection**
Front-running and sandwich attacks are *automatically* prevented by Mato's design. Trade with confidence, knowing your orders are shielded from malicious bots.

**üöÄ Blazing Fast & Ultra-Low Fees**
Built natively on Solana, Mato leverages the network's speed for near-instant order processing and negligible transaction costs.

**üîí Trade Within Your Limit**
Set a Limit Price to ensure your trade only executes at or better than your desired level. If the market doesn't meet your price during the duration, your funds are safely returned ‚Äì no failed transactions due to price!

**üìä See Your Savings**
After each successful trade, Mato shows you how the gradual execution helped you save compared to what an immediate market swap might have cost.

**Trading on Mato is Simple:**

We've designed the interface to be intuitive for everyone. You only need to set three things:

1.  **Amount:** How much crypto you want to trade.
    *(Tooltip: "Enter the total amount you wish to trade.")*
2.  **Duration:** How long you want your order to gradually execute in the market.
    *(Tooltip: "Set how long your order will gradually execute in the market. Longer durations usually give better prices.")*
    *(Default Suggestion: "Recommended duration: 10 minutes (balances speed and price efficiency).")*
3.  **Limit Price:** The minimum price you're willing to accept for your trade.
    *(Tooltip: "Your trade will only execute at or better than this price.")*

**(Section on Transaction Feedback/Visualization - Imagine a small animated progress bar)**

**See Your Order Come to Life**

Watch your trade execute in real-time with a clear progress indicator showing how much time is left and how much of your order has filled.

*   **If your limit price isn't met:** We'll clearly inform you: "Your order is active but outside the current market price. If market prices move within your limit, your trade will automatically execute."
*   **If no trade happens:** At the end of the duration, we clearly state: "No trades executed‚Äîmarket prices did not reach your limit. Your funds have been returned."
